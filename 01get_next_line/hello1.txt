Here’s a simple recipe for a classic pasta dish:

1. Boil 200g of pasta in salted water according to package instructions.
2. While the pasta cooks, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a pan over medium heat.
3. Add 2 minced garlic cloves and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
4. Add 1 can (400g) of crushed tomatoes, salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar.
5. Let the sauce simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
6. Once the pasta is done, drain it and reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water.
7. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce, tossing it well.
8. Add a little reserved pasta water if needed to create a smoother sauce.
9. Stir in 1/4 cup of freshly chopped basil.
10. Serve with grated Parmesan on top and enjoy!
